  // You must implement a page that shows a table that lists of all the food consumed over a selected period
  // of time, along with the calories and macros that are contained in the quantity of food specified. You
  // must implement this page in such a way that clicking on the column headings will make your page sort
  // based on that column. First click should sort in ascending order, a second should sort in descending
  // order, and subsequent clicks just toggle that back and forth.
